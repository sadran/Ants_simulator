-To run the all the experiments with the same configuration as "Hacking the Colony" paper, please run "main.py". 
results will be logged in "result" directory

-in the main() functoin, you can uncomment test() functoin and comment any thing else to run simulation with an arbitrary configuration.
it's recommended to change the configs from test() function, instead of changing the config file directly 

-in the main() function, you can uncomment plot() function to plot the results. (this function is not completed yet, so probabely doesn't work properly)
